## 3: You may look at the code

It's not the best, but its the journey that matters.

## 4: You can run this locally, or make changes if needed

This project has been made using PHP 8.1.
Please make sure to use PHP 8.1+ to run this project.
That's all that's needed to run the game.

If you wish to contribute, you also need Composer installed.
Then, don't forget to install composer dependencies using the `composer install` command in your terminal.
You can now make changes to the code.
When making changes to PHP files, you can run `compoeser test` to make sure your changes comply with the coding standards and contain no obvious bugs.
Those tests will also run when creating a PR for the repository. Tests must be passed before changes can be merged into the source code.
